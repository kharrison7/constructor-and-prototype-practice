Daily Project: Constructor and Prototype Practice (Completed)
Constructor and Prototype Practice
In this project, you will work on creating constructors and prototypes that will help pass a series of pre-written tests.

To help you better understand constructors and prototypes in JavaScript you will need to download the following files to get started.

Download Starter Files
starter_files.zip (2 KB)
Inside of the starter_files, you'll find three files.

index.html: A generic HTML file that you will need to get running in the browser
main.js: Where all of your work will happen
tests.js: The testing suite to test your work. You'll want to explore this file, but not edit it.
You'll need to open the HTML file in the browser and open up your browser's JavaScript console.

There will be a series of console statements that you need to make pass in the main.js file. You may not edit the testing functions or the test statements in the tests.js file. It will help to view the tests.js file to take a look at the tests that are running.

You'll be required to write some code in both the Dog and Human constructor as well as create the instances listed with the correct properties.

Hints  

You will need to use your newfound knowledge of constructors and prototypes to solve each of the test functions, as you pass one, a new one will pop up and give you the criteria needed to make it pass. The first one is completed as a freebie for you - you will need to solve the rest!
